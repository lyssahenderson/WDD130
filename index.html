            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Lyssa Henderson and I'm from Spokane, Washington! 
                I am a Computer Information Technology major. I enjoy baking, reading, hiking, and anything that has to do with music.
                I am the oldest of four, so I have three younger siblings. My brother is currently on a mission in Vancouver, Canada, and will be back at BYU when he comes home in a year.
                My sisters are both in high school, one is going to be a senior and one is going to be a sophmore when school starts again in the fall.
                My family loves to play a variety of games, tennis, and play music together.
            </p>

                The capital is Olympia, although most people know the state because of Seattle, where there are many tourist attractions.</p>
